# RTGF Architecture Overview

This section captures the high-level architecture for the Reference Token Generation Framework (RTGF).

## Documents
- `policy-source-matrix.md` — defines the canonical policy snapshot matrix feeding the RTGF compiler.
- `rtgf-pipeline.md` — end-to-end blueprint for policy ingestion → compiler → registry → verifier.
- `SYSTEMS_ARCHITECTURE.md` — infrastructure view: deployment topology, trust boundaries, and operational controls.
- `SOFTWARE_ARCHITECTURE.md` — module/component view: compiler, registry, verifier, schemas, and data contracts.
- `sapp-alignment.md` — maps the RTGF roadmap to current SAPP token and DOP test-client work.

Additional domain-specific annexes and EU worked examples will be added as the project evolves.
