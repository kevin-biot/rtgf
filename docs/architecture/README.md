# RTGF Architecture Overview

This section captures the high-level architecture for the Reference Token Generation Framework (RTGF).

## Documents
- `policy-source-matrix.md` — defines the canonical policy snapshot matrix feeding the RTGF compiler.
- `rtgf-pipeline.md` — end-to-end blueprint for policy ingestion → compiler → registry → verifier.

Additional domain-specific annexes and EU worked examples will be added as the project evolves.
